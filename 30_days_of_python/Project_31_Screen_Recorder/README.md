# Python Screen Recorder

This is a simple screen recorder built using Python's `pyautogui` library. It captures the screen and saves the recording as a video file.

## Features

- **Screen Recording:** Captures the entire screen.
- **Customizable Recording Duration:** Specify how long you want to record.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - `pyautogui`
  - `opencv-python` (for video processing)
  - `numpy` (for handling frame data)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogui opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

To start recording the screen, run the `screen_recorder.py` script:

```bash
python screen_recorder.py
```

The recorded video will be saved in the project directory as `output.avi`.

## Acknowledgments

- The `pyautogui` library for providing easy screen capture functionality.
- The `opencv-python` library for handling video processing.
