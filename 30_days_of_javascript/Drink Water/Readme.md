# Drink Water

A simple web application to help you track your daily water intake. The goal is to drink 2 liters of water per day, and this app provides a visual and interactive way to monitor your progress.

## Overview

The "Drink Water" project is a lightweight single-page application designed to help you stay hydrated. It uses a series of clickable cups, each representing 250 ml of water. As you drink more water and click the cups, the app visually fills up a large cup to show your progress toward the daily goal of 2 liters.

## Features

- **Progress Visualization**: A dynamic display showing the percentage of your goal achieved.
- **Remained Water**: Automatically calculates and displays how much water you still need to drink.
