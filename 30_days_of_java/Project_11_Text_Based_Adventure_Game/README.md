The Text-Based Adventure Game is a Java-based command-line game where the player embarks on a journey filled with decisions that lead to different paths and outcomes. It is designed to be a simple yet engaging experience, allowing users to interact with the story through text input.

This project is part of the `30DaysDevChallenge` under the `30_days_of_java` folder and serves as a way to practice and enhance Java programming skills, particularly in handling user input, control flow, and basic game design.

**Example Gameplay:**

```
Welcome to the Text-Based Adventure Game!
Your journey begins now...

You find yourself at a crossroads in a dark forest.
Do you want to go left into the unknown, or right towards the distant lights?
Type 'left' or 'right': left

You walk down a narrow path, surrounded by tall trees. The air grows colder...
```
